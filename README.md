# DSCVR

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## App Description

Ever been bored on a Tuesday? 

Have children but find yourself going crazy at home? 

Have a pet that requires exercise? 

Have a partner who requires your attention? 

DSCVR will take care of you, then. To find your next activity, use the new Tag-based search engine in this app. There is no need to type; simply choose from a few simple but essential Tags to find the ideal activity. Create an account and offer your assistance to others by leaving reviews. If you discover a new location, go ahead and add that listing as well. 

Try something new, DSCVR.
